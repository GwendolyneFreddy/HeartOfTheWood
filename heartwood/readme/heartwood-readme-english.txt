Heart of the Wood (for BGII: Throne of Bhaal)

Contents: This magical stick can summon some powerful forest monsters and creatures (with some new ones from the monsters compendium) to aid your druid in combat, although the overall HD of the summoned creatures is limited to 13. This item can be acquired from Kyland Lind (Druid Grove). You must kill him first for it of course.

Warning: Kyland Lind is going to use the branch against your party!

Note: Only druids can use it!

Have fun using it, I had some making it!
